### **1️⃣ Account Risk Check**

**Purpose:** Ensure your trading account has enough balance to safely take trades.
**What it does:**

* Checks if your account balance is above zero or a minimum required threshold.
* Prevents taking trades that could over-leverage or risk a negative balance.
  **Example:** If your account balance is $100 and you risk 2% per trade, you can only risk $2 per trade. If your balance is $0, no trades are allowed.

### **2️⃣ Market Regime Check**

**Purpose:** Confirm that the current market conditions are suitable for trading.
**What it does:**

* Filters trades based on market trend, volatility, or session (e.g., London or New York session).
* Helps avoid entering trades during choppy or unfavorable market conditions.
  **Example:** Only take trades in trending markets or when volatility is within acceptable limits.

### **3️⃣ Risk Definition**

**Purpose:** Define exactly how much you are willing to lose on a trade.
**What it does:**

* Sets the **stop-loss (SL)** level based on strategy or technical analysis.
* Calculates the **dollar risk** using your account balance and chosen risk % per trade.
  **Example:** If your entry is $100, SL is $98, and your risk per trade is 2% of a $10,000 account, you risk $200.

### **4️⃣ Position Sizing**

**Purpose:** Determine how large your trade should be.
**What it does:**

* Uses the dollar risk and stop-loss distance to calculate the correct trade size.
* Ensures each trade risks only a fixed % of your balance, regardless of market price.
  **Example:** With $200 at risk and SL distance of $2, you would buy 100 units/contracts.

---

### **5️⃣ Entry Confirmation**

**Purpose:** Decide whether to enter a trade.
**What it does:**

* Checks for a trading signal from your strategy (buy/sell).
* Confirms the signal aligns with your risk and market regime filters.
  **Example:** Your strategy signals a “buy” on EURUSD; market conditions are favorable, so the trade is approved.

---

### **6️⃣ Execution**

**Purpose:** Place the trade with proper size, entry, and stop-loss.
**What it does:**

* Sends the order to your broker or trading platform (e.g., MetaTrader5).
* Records the trade in your system for tracking and management.
  **Example:** Buy EURUSD at $100 with 100 units and SL at $98. The system executes the trade and logs it.

💡 **Summary:**
These steps create a **systematic, risk-controlled trading workflow**. Each step reduces emotional decisions, ensures consistent position sizing, and manages risk automatically.
