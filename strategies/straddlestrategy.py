Straddle Strategy — Live Version (stateless)
=============================================
Edge   : Direction is close to a coin flip at session-open timescale, but
         WHEN a genuine breakout is likely (session/hour) is predictable
         (AUC 0.75 across 4 walk-forward folds). Rather than guess
         direction, place orders on both sides at each pair's own best
         entry hour and let the market pick.
Entry  : Buy-stop + sell-stop straddle at each symbol's trigger hour.
         Whichever fills first is the trade; the other is cancelled (OCO).
SL     : Fixed distance from entry (25 pips FX / $20 XAU / $600 BTC).
Exit   : Trail from 1R, 20 pips (FX) / $15 (XAU) / $450 (BTC) per bar — no
         fixed TP, EXCEPT an adaptive max-hold rule: every position is
         force-closed 1 hour before its OWN symbol's NEXT scheduled
         trigger time — capped so it can NEVER bridge the weekend, for
         symbols that actually close on weekends (see
         WEEKEND_CLOSED_SYMBOLS below; BTCUSDm trades 7 days/week in the
         backtest data and is deliberately excluded from this cap). A
         Friday fill on a weekend-closed symbol always closes by 20:00 UTC
         that same Friday, regardless of how early it filled, rather than
         riding through to Monday's trigger and taking on weekend gap risk
         (mirrors the monthly bot's own Friday hard-close rule). This
         replaced an earlier flat 24-hour cap after backtesting showed the
         flat version let a still-open trade silently block the next
         day's entry ~0.4-6.2% of the time depending on symbol (worst on
         EURUSD, 6.2%) — the bot would just skip placing a new straddle
         that day, which the original backtest never modeled. The
         adaptive version fixes the skip problem completely and improved
         3 of 4 FX/gold symbols outright — GBPUSD nearly doubled:
         625p -> 1,173p.
Breaker: Cross-pair — pauses ALL new entries if 2+ symbols each show 2+
         consecutive losses. A per-pair breaker was tested and made
         results worse (cuts a pair off right before its own recovery);
         the cross-pair version targets a real, evidenced failure mode —
         GBPUSD and USDJPY failed simultaneously for two months in the
         2024-2026 backtest, and this catches exactly that.

STATELESS BY DESIGN: this file keeps no trade, order, or result state in
memory anywhere. Every method re-derives what it needs from MT5 directly —
open positions via positions_get(), pending orders via orders_get(), win/
loss history via history_deals_get(). A bot restart loses nothing, because
nothing lives outside MT5 in the first place. This also removes the
"permanent pause freeze" risk a naive in-memory circuit breaker can hit:
since streaks are recomputed from real deal history on every call, and the
breaker has a hard max-pause fallback below, it cannot get stuck open
forever the way an in-memory-only version can.

Backtest summary (2024-2026, Exness M15 data, $90 start, 1% risk/trade,
adaptive per-symbol deadline applied — no silently skipped days):
  EURUSDm @ 08:00 UTC : 503 trades, 51.1% win rate, 567 pips, $146.67 final
  USDJPYm @ 08:00 UTC : 513 trades, 54.0% win rate, 2823 pips, $278.22 final
  GBPUSDm @ 04:00 UTC : 504 trades, 51.0% win rate, 1173 pips, $207.26 final
    (08:00 UTC — which works for EUR/JPY — LOSES money on GBPUSD; UK data
    releases at 06:00-07:00 UTC, so 04:00 sits ahead of the catalyst while
    08:00 catches the retest/reversal instead of the move itself)
  XAUUSDm @ 01:00 UTC : 473 trades, 60.0% win rate, $2460.45 final — best
    validated hour from a 22-hour sweep.
  BTCUSDm @ 15:00 UTC : 512 trades, 56.6% win rate, $789.25 final (Jul
    2024-Dec 2025 data). Best of a 22-hour sweep, no cross-asset
    confirmation (unlike EUR/JPY's independent agreement on 08:00 UTC).
    Held up on 2 checks: train/test split (58.6%->54.7% win rate) and
    year-by-year %-normalized return, stable 2024 vs 2025 (0.154% vs
    0.159% avg/trade — not a price-appreciation artifact). Risk per trade
    at 0.01 lot floor: $6.00 = 6.7% of a $90 account — better than gold's
    22% but still above the 1% target. BTC_ENABLED is True here at
    Joseph's explicit instruction to test now — ***CONTRACT SIZE STILL
    UNVERIFIED*** at the time this flag was flipped. pip_value_per_lot()
    below assumes 1.0 lot = 1 BTC ($1 move = $1 P&L per 1.0 lot), inferred
    only from price data, never confirmed against Exness's real BTCUSDm
    spec. Check `mt5.symbol_info("BTCUSDm").trade_contract_size` on the
    actual account as soon as possible — if it isn't 1.0, every BTC
    position size placed until this is checked is silently wrong, not
    crash-wrong, so it won't announce itself as a problem on its own.
  XAGUSDm @ 14:00 UTC : SILVER_ENABLED=True at Joseph's explicit
    instruction. ***CONTRACT SIZE UNVERIFIED*** — same situation as BTC
    above. pip_value_per_lot() assumes 1.0 lot = 5000 oz ($1 move = $5000
    P&L per 1.0 lot), a common XAGUSD contract size but NOT confirmed
    against Exness's real XAGUSDm spec. Check
    `mt5.symbol_info("XAGUSDm").trade_contract_size` on the actual account
    ASAP — if it isn't 5000, every silver position size placed until this
    is checked is silently wrong in the same way the BTC one could be.

CHANGE LOG (this revision):
  - Fixed XAGUSDm's SYMBOL_CONFIG entry, which was missing required keys
    ("pip", "cancel_hour") and carried two dead keys that nothing in this
    file ever reads ("risk_pct" — self.risk_pct is the only one used;
    "friday_cap_hour" — WEEKLY_CLOSE_HOUR is the only one used). The
    missing "cancel_hour" crashed check_and_place() with a KeyError on
    first live call. The missing "pip" was the more dangerous bug: it
    didn't crash — _pip() silently fell back to the FX default of 0.0001,
    which would have multiplied XAGUSDm's USD-denominated offset/sl/trail
    values (0.06, 0.12, 0.09) down to near-zero, placing both straddle
    legs essentially on top of the live price. XAGUSDm now carries
    "pip": 1.0, same as XAUUSDm/BTCUSDm, since its offset/sl/trail values
    are already expressed directly in USD.
  - Added XAGUSDm to WEEKEND_CLOSED_SYMBOLS — spot silver closes for the
    weekend like gold and FX, so without this a Friday fill would ride
    through to Monday's trigger deadline instead of hard-closing Friday
    at WEEKLY_CLOSE_HOUR, taking on the exact weekend gap risk that set
    exists to prevent.
  - Added SILVER_ENABLED / SILVER_MIN_BALANCE, mirroring the existing
    GOLD_ENABLED/BTC_ENABLED gating pattern, and added XAGUSDm to the
    traded_symbols gating in __init__. SILVER_ENABLED=True at Joseph's
    explicit instruction — contract-size assumption unverified, see the
    backtest summary note above.
  - Added an XAGUSDm branch to _pip_value_per_lot(); without it silver
    would have silently fallen through to the generic $10/pip FX default,
    which is wrong for a USD-denominated symbol — the same class of
    silent-fallback bug the missing "pip" config key had.
  - Added BTCUSDm to SYMBOL_CONFIG and WEEKEND_CLOSED_SYMBOLS to make the
    Friday weekly-close cap apply only to symbols that actually close on
    weekends — BTC traded 7 days/week in the backtest data, so
    force-closing it every Friday would cut off real weekend price action
    for no matching gap-risk reason. BTC_ENABLED=True at Joseph's explicit
    request to test now — contract-size assumption unverified, see the
    backtest summary note above.
  - XAUUSDm confirmed back at its validated trigger_hour=1/trigger_minute=0
    (a brief 08:30 test config was considered and reverted before this
    revision — BTC was the one that needed enabling, not gold's hour).
  - Added _get_tick(symbol): every tick read in this file now goes through
    this one helper, which calls mt5.symbol_select(symbol, True) before
    mt5.symbol_info_tick(symbol). Root cause of the 2026-07-21 GBPUSDm
    04:00 miss: symbol_info_tick() returns None for any symbol not
    currently in the terminal's Market Watch list — it does NOT auto-add
    it. EUR/JPY/gold happened to already be watched, GBPUSDm wasn't, so
    check_and_place() silently returned "No tick data" and no straddle
    was placed. symbol_select() is the same action as right-clicking a
    symbol and choosing "Show Symbol" in the terminal, done in code, on
    every call, so the bot never again depends on Market Watch already
    being set up correctly. Applied consistently to all three places that
    used to call mt5.symbol_info_tick() directly (check_and_place,
    _close_position_at_market, manage_open_trade) rather than only
    patching the one that broke.
