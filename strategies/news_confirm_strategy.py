News Spike Strategy — Live Version (stateless)
================================================
Edge   : Straddle-at-release entry (same OCO pattern as
         news_reload_strategy.py), but radically simplified on the exit
         side: NO take-profit, NO reload chain. Once a position opens, it
         gets a HARD 1-MINUTE force-close — win or lose, whatever it's
         worth at that moment, it closes. After that single close (or an
         SL hit, if that happens first), this specific event is DONE —
         no re-entry, no matter how much time is left in the trigger
         window.

         The idea: capture only the very first, immediate reaction to a
         scheduled release, then get out before a possible reversal —
         rather than staying in the market and riding it (which hurt
         other mechanics tested this session: the 2026-03-06 NFP
         reversal, and the 2024-12-06 NFP bar that spiked $12+ and then
         round-tripped almost all the way back to flat within 30 min).
         One shot per event, then done.

Entry  : Buy-stop + sell-stop straddle, placed in a narrow PRE-RELEASE
         window only (see "Entry window" below) — offset from the
         anchor price (per-symbol distance below). Whichever side fills
         is the trade. Covers NFP, CPI, and FOMC — each on its own
         schedule (NFP/CPI at 8:30 AM ET, FOMC at 2:00 PM ET).
SL     : Real per-symbol stop — can still trigger before the 1-minute
         mark if price moves against it fast enough. NOTE: real Sept 4
         2026 tick-level analysis (see 2026-09-08 CHANGE LOG) confirmed
         this SL is a price level, not a payment cap — a fast cascade
         can jump straight through it. Sizing is set conservatively
         (7% flat, see below) partly to keep that tail survivable, not
         because the SL itself got tighter.
Exit   : Hard 1-minute force-close, no TP, no reload. Whichever comes
         first — the SL hitting, or 60 seconds elapsing — ends the
         trade. Exit deviation is now effectively uncapped (see
         2026-09-08 CHANGE LOG) so this close cannot get rejected and
         silently retried through a volatile window.
Sizing : Flat 7% risk per symbol (see 2026-09-08 CHANGE LOG), computed
         once at entry — no reload here to grow it further.
Filter : NONE. See prior revision's docstring — the FOMC-proximity
         filter was tested and removed for THIS mechanic specifically
         (helped the reload chain, hurt the spike mechanic). Not
         re-litigated here.

Entry window : Every date in the three schedule constants below is
         stored 5 SECONDS EARLY relative to the real, source-verified
         release time (e.g. real NFP release 12:30:00 UTC is stored as
         12:29:55). This is deliberate, not a mistake — see CHANGE LOG.
         The entry window itself is only the 5 seconds before the real
         release — `_next_event_trigger_window()` opens at the stored
         (early) time and closes hard AT the real release. If a
         straddle has not been placed by the real release moment, that
         symbol sits out the event entirely — no retry after price has
         already moved. The point of the spike edge is catching the
         FIRST move; chasing it after release defeats the purpose and
         re-exposes the entry to the same price/stops_level rejection
         risk this change exists to avoid. (Considered narrowing to 3s
         on 2026-09-08 — explicitly rejected: doesn't reduce slippage,
         the mechanism that matters happens post-trigger not
         post-placement, and a narrower window only raises the odds a
         poll cycle steps over it entirely. Left at 5s.)

*** VALIDATED EVIDENCE — XAUUSDm ONLY ***
XAUUSDm is backed by real, minute-level, control-tested backtest data
(2024-01-02 to 2025-12-05, see prior revision's docstring for the full
NFP/CPI/FOMC breakdown — 59.1%/54.5%/66.7% win rates, all beat random-
time controls). A single real tick-level event (Sept 4 2026 NFP) was
also walked through in detail — see 2026-09-08 CHANGE LOG — and
confirmed the mechanic can survive a violent, discontinuous cascade
when direction cooperates; it does NOT establish the SL reliably caps
loss when direction doesn't cooperate. Still a single event.

*** XAGUSDm — STRUCTURAL, NOT VALIDATED ***
XAGUSDm's offset/SL are uncalibrated guesses scaled roughly off gold's
by relative price level — no backtest, no random-time control, no
year-over-year check. One real tick-level walkthrough exists (Sept 4
2026 NFP, see CHANGE LOG) and it was a clean win, but the dollar figure
from that walkthrough leaned on an ASSUMED contract size (5000oz) that
was never confirmed against this account's real
`symbol_info("XAGUSDm").trade_contract_size` — treat that P&L number
as directionally right, not precisely right, until confirmed live.

*** COPPER (XCUUSDm) REMOVED 2026-09-08 *** — see CHANGE LOG. Only
XAUUSDm and XAGUSDm are traded by this file now.

*** STILL DEMO ONLY (all symbols) ***

CHANGE LOG (2026-09-08):
  - REMOVED XCUUSDm (copper) from SYMBOL_CONFIG entirely. Reasoning:
    reviewing Sept 4 2026 NFP on real tick data alongside gold/silver
    showed copper's confirmed contract spec (contract_size=1.0,
    tick_value=0.01, tick_size=0.01 -> only $1 of P&L per $1 price move
    per 1.0 lot) is drastically lower leverage than gold/silver, which
    forced the sizing formula toward an unusually large lot count
    (~0.67 lots at 7% risk) just to hit the same target risk in
    dollars. Combined with copper's volume_min/max/step still being
    unconfirmed against the broker (flagged since 2026-08-30 and never
    resolved), this symbol's real live behavior was the least trusted
    of the three and was dropped rather than carried further
    unvalidated. Only XAUUSDm and XAGUSDm remain.
  - risk_pct changed from differentiated (XAU 14.04% / XAG 14.04%) to
    FLAT 7% on both remaining symbols. Total budget: ~33.2% (7 symbols,
    original) -> ~28.08% (XAU+XAG only, pre-copper-removal) -> 14%
    (flat 7% x 2, this change). Reasoning: reviewing real Sept 4 2026
    tick data showed the SL is a price level, not an enforced payment
    cap — a fast cascade can jump straight through it (measured ~$40
    worst-case range on gold in the 300ms after one real trigger,
    against a nominal $7 SL). Flat 7% doesn't fix that mechanism, it
    just keeps the tail outcome proportionally survivable rather than
    changing the underlying risk/reward shape. A deeper fix (sizing
    lot off realistic worst-case distance instead of nominal SL) was
    discussed and deliberately deferred, not done here.
  - `_close_position_at_market()` and `_flatten_symbol()` deviation
    changed from 10 to a large effectively-uncapped value
    (`EXIT_DEVIATION`). Root cause this fixes: at deviation=10, a
    force-close or pre-event flatten attempted during real volatility
    (measured real spread of 340pts on a live release bar; separately,
    a real ~$40 tick-level price cascade on Sept 4) could get REJECTED
    by the broker rather than filled-with-slippage, and
    manage_open_trade() would just log "will retry next cycle" and try
    again — meaning the "hard 60-second" exit could silently drift to
    65s, 90s, or longer while it kept retrying through the worst of
    the move, exactly the opposite of what the hard exit exists to
    guarantee. deviation is a MAXIMUM tolerance, not a target — this
    change costs nothing on calm exits (still fills at the best
    available price) and only changes behavior on the volatile ones,
    which is exactly when a guaranteed exit matters most.
  - 5s-early entry window (EARLY_ENTRY_SECONDS) considered for a
    narrowing to 3s, explicitly REJECTED after discussion. The
    mechanism that actually causes entry slippage/liquidity gaps lives
    in the seconds AFTER the real release triggers the order, not in
    how many seconds early the resting order was placed — moving from
    5s to 2-3s early does not touch that mechanism at all, it only
    shrinks the window's margin for the main loop's poll cycle to
    reliably land inside it. Left at 5.0.
  - Test NFP entry (2026-09-08, marked "# test" in NFP_SCHEDULE_UTC)
    left in place, untouched — not part of this change set.

CHANGE LOG (2026-09-04, risk_pct redistribution):
  - risk_pct redistributed across just XAUUSDm/XAGUSDm/XCUUSDm, preserving
    the original 33.2143% total budget (previously spread across 7
    symbols) rather than leaving it reduced to 20.2857%. Same relative
    weighting kept: XAUUSDm=XAGUSDm=14.04% each, XCUUSDm=5.26% (XCU's
    share stayed proportionally smaller than XAU/XAG's, same ratio as
    when it matched the FX-pair share — not equalized up just because
    the FX pairs are gone). SUPERSEDED 2026-09-08 — see above (flat 7%,
    copper removed).

CHANGE LOG (2026-09-04, gold/silver/copper only):
  - FINAL DECISION — the four FX pairs (EURUSDm, GBPUSDm, USDJPYm,
    USDCADm) are REMOVED from SYMBOL_CONFIG entirely. This strategy now
    trades ONLY XAUUSDm, XAGUSDm, XCUUSDm. Total budget across the
    remaining 3 symbols was initially left at 8.5714% + 8.5714% + 3.2143%
    = 20.2857% (down from 33.2143% across 7 symbols) — SUPERSEDED the
    same day: risk_pct was then redistributed so the original 33.2143%
    total is preserved, concentrated on just these 3 symbols instead of
    being left smaller (see risk_pct redistribution entry below).
  - The FX pairs' offset/SL tuning history (12p/20p initial -> 14p/24p
    widened -> 5p/8p narrowed, all same day) is now moot for live
    trading but left in this changelog for the record, since it's real
    evidence about how sensitive this mechanic is to offset/SL choice
    on FX symbols, in case they're ever re-added.

CHANGE LOG (2026-09-04, entry-window/polling changes):
  - All three schedule constants (NFP/CPI/FOMC_SCHEDULE_UTC) shifted 5
    seconds EARLY relative to the real, source-verified release times.
    Root cause this fixes: live rejections at exact release time
    (XAUUSDm SELL retcode=10015 "Invalid price", XAGUSDm SELL
    retcode=10006) traced to two compounding release-moment effects —
    (1) the anchor price used to compute offset/SL is fetched a beat
    before order_send() reaches the broker, and during the NFP spike
    price can move enough in that gap that the calculated stop is no
    longer where it was meant to be relative to current price, and (2)
    brokers (Exness included) widen trade_stops_level dynamically the
    instant high-impact volatility hits, shrinking the minimum-distance
    room a stop order needs. Both effects are real only AT/AFTER the
    real release moment, not before it — placing the pending straddle
    as a RESTING order 5s before release sidesteps both, since stops-
    level and price validation happen at placement time, not
    continuously against a resting order.
  - `_next_event_trigger_window()` narrowed to a HARD pre-release-only
    window: opens at the stored (5s-early) release_time, closes AT the
    real release moment (release_time + 5s). Previously stayed open for
    a full 5 minutes after release to allow retries; that retry window
    is deliberately removed. Rationale: the spike edge is about catching
    the FIRST move — once real release has passed and price has already
    moved, there's no move left to catch, and retrying would just
    resubmit into the exact volatile conditions this change exists to
    avoid. If a symbol's early placement attempt fails, that symbol sits
    out the event; no second chance within the same release.
  - `_next_flatten_window()` default `lead_minutes` changed 5.0 -> 10.0
    — longer pre-event runway to guarantee nothing from either this
    strategy or straddle_strategy.py is still open going into an event.
    Window is computed off the stored (5s-early) release_time, so in
    real-world terms flatten now runs from 10:00 before the real release
    down to 5s before it, handing off directly to the entry window with
    no gap.
  - Requires ~1s main-loop polling to be reliable — a 5-second-wide
    entry window with slower polling (e.g. the old 30s cadence) risks
    a poll cycle stepping over the entire window without ever checking
    inside it, silently reverting to no entry for that event. Not
    enforced in this file (that's main_news_spike.py's job) — noted
    here since it's a real dependency of this change actually working.

CHANGE LOG (2026-08-30):
  - Added XCUUSDm (copper), risk_pct=3.2143% (same share as each FX
    pair). Offset=12.0 / SL=20.0 (price units, digits=2) — carried over
    from the single-event NFP backtest, not independently fitted to
    copper's own volatility. Total budget across all 7 symbols is now
    33.2143% (was 30%) — unchanged unless/until Joseph asks for a
    rebalance. REMOVED 2026-09-08 — see CHANGE LOG above.

CHANGE LOG (2026-08-12):
  - Re-added the unconditional final flatten check immediately before
    order placement in check_and_place() — this had been dropped during
    a revert and is the actual fix for the EURUSDm-not-closing-before-
    NFP bug reported live. The window-based flatten (_next_flatten_window,
    lead_minutes before release) depends on the main loop calling
    check_and_place() every cycle in that window; if the main loop's
    per-symbol routing sends a symbol to manage_open_trade() instead
    (observed live 2026-08-12 on EURUSDm, one minute before release, no
    position ever placed by this bot so manage_open_trade() correctly
    reported "No open trade" every time — meaning check_and_place(),
    and therefore the flatten logic, was never even called for it), the
    window-based flatten silently never runs for that symbol. The final
    check at the last possible moment before order placement is a second,
    independent layer that doesn't depend on the window timing lining up
    with when the main loop happens to call this method — it runs
    unconditionally every time check_and_place() reaches that point,
    which happens across many cycles inside the whole trigger window,
    not just the exact cycle the window check catches.
  - Trimmed to 6 symbols (XAUUSDm, XAGUSDm, EURUSDm, GBPUSDm, USDJPYm,
    USDCADm) per Joseph's request — USDCHFm/AUDUSDm/NZDUSDm removed.
  - FX offset/SL settled at 12/20 pips (reverted from an intermediate
    8/15p tighten that was catching fakeouts on slower releases).
  - Flatten lead time set to 5 minutes (down from an initial 10) — since
    revised again to 10 minutes, see 2026-09-04 entry above.
  - Added _next_flatten_window()/_flatten_symbol(): closes ANY position
    and cancels ANY pending order on a symbol, regardless of magic
    number, in the lead-up to a scheduled event — deliberate, simpler
    alternative to hedging-mode detection/blocking. This strategy shares
    EURUSDm/GBPUSDm/USDJPYm/XAUUSDm with straddle_strategy.py
    (MAGIC=20260716); flattening the symbol before entry means there's
    nothing left for a netting-mode account to merge with.
  - Lot sizing rewritten in a prior pass to pull live from
    mt5.symbol_info(symbol).trade_tick_value/trade_tick_size instead of
    a static pip-value guess table, which had been wrong by orders of
    magnitude for several symbols (2026-08-11: USDJPYm computed 42
    lots, XAGUSDm 17.62 lots, off hand-guessed constants).

CHANGE LOG (2026-08-11, earlier same day):
  - Added XAGUSDm + 7 major USD pairs (later trimmed to 4, see above).
  - Added `decimals` to SYMBOL_CONFIG per symbol and generalized
    `_round_price()` off it instead of a single XAUUSDm special-case.
  - Added automatic hedging-mode check at import time (informational;
    superseded operationally by the flatten-before-entry approach above,
    but left in place as a diagnostic).

CHANGE LOG (prior revision):
  - Expanded from NFP-only to three event types: NFP, CPI, FOMC - each
    on its own real, source-verified schedule.
  - Removed the FOMC-proximity filter entirely - helped the reload
    chain, hurt this mechanic when tested directly.

CHANGE LOG (initial):
  - Initial build. Fourth standalone strategy, own MAGIC number, own
    process — same pattern as straddle_strategy.py, news_confirm_
    strategy.py, and news_reload_strategy.py never sharing a loop.
  - Includes the "already traded this event" guard from the start,
    given a live bug found in news_reload_strategy.py on 2026-08-07.
